How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Easily can make out difference which line was added or removed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Take less time to figure out changes and if there was issue to find bug and resolve.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros - Git- Meaningful commits
	   Auto - Have nearlyy all history of changes

    Cons - Git - if programmer is lazy then less history or history can be lost
           Auto - No meaningful commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Because gits mainly used bby programmers where multiple files effected at a time. Google Docs are mainly used to write something on a file which is not interalted to any other  files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log ahs all commit history and with git diff we can compare any two versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Very confident as I could esily figure out where the break happened. I have safety cushion 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    coding
